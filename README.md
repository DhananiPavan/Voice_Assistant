The Python Voice Assistant project is a simplified AI-powered application designed to simulate the core functionalities of Apple Siri. It allows users to interact with their computer using natural voice commands, enabling hands-free control and smart assistance. Built using Python, the assistant can listen to user input, understand voice commands, and perform actions such as playing music on YouTube, telling the current time, opening applications or websites, and even generating intelligent responses using OpenAI's GPT model.

The assistant uses libraries like speech_recognition for capturing and converting speech to text, pyttsx3 for generating voice responses, pywhatkit and webbrowser for performing tasks, and openai for integrating natural language understanding. The project offers a foundational framework for voice-controlled automation and can be extended with features like reminders, weather updates, or smart home control.
